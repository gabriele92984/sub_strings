# sub_strings
Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found

The aim is first to define a #normalize method the string in order do get as output an array of plain words text, so we have to clean that string from any punctuation, apostrophes used to show possession or letters contractions, then transform it into array and then compare it to the array dictionary building up a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
